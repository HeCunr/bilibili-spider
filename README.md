# 2024 Paris Olympics Video Danmaku Analysis and Mining

This project focuses on analyzing and mining danmaku (bullet comments) from videos related to the 2024 Paris Olympics. By scraping data from Bilibili (Bç«™), it explores public perceptions of AI technology applications during the event, complemented by data visualization and statistical insights into the fusion of technology and sports.

## Project Background

The 33rd Summer Olympic Games (Paris 2024) took place from July 26 to August 11, 2024, in Paris, France. Marking Paris's third time hosting the Summer Olympics (after 1900 and 1924), it became the second city after London to achieve this feat. The United States topped the medal tally with 40 gold medals and 126 total medals, tied with China for gold (40) but ahead in total medals (91 for China). Host nation France secured 16 gold medals and 64 total medals, ranking fifth. The 2024 Paris Olympics was not only a sporting spectacle but also a showcase of industrial digitization, with AI technology seamlessly integrated into event organization, broadcasting, and audience experiences, heralding a new era of tech-enhanced sports.

This project scrapes danmaku from Bilibili to analyze AI technology applications in the 2024 Paris Olympics, uncovering trends in the intersection of technology and athletics.
